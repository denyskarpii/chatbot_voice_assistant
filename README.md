## Working
The working of the assistant is pretty simple.
First, a simple GUI shows up, in which you can see all your ongoing conversation.
When we click on the speak icon, it detects the voice and converts it to text using
speech_recognition module. 
On the text, first NLP is applied that creates a bag of words model which is then passed to a pre trained neural network made using the tflearn module. This network returns the "tag" with which 
the sentence is associated(see intents.json). 
This "tag" is then used to find the "sub tag" with which the sentence is associated
again with the help of the same model.
Once, the subtag is determined, it returns the appropriate answer associated with that
subtag, and the pyttsx3 module is used to convey the answer through voice.
